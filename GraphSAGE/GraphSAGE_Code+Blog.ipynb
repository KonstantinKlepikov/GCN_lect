    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous blogs, we covered GCN and DeepWalk, which are methods to generate node embeddings. The basic\n",
    "idea behind node embedding approaches is to use dimensionality reduction techniques to distill the\n",
    "high-dimensional information about a node’s neighborhood into a dense vector embedding. These\n",
    "node embeddings can then be fed to downstream machine learning systems and aid in tasks such as\n",
    "node classification, clustering, and link prediction. Let us move on to a slightly different problem. Now, we need the embeddings for each node of a graph where new nodes are continuously being added. A possible way to do this would be to rerun the entire model (GCN or DeepWalk) on the new graph, but it is computationally expensive. Today we will be covering GraphSAGE, a method that will allow us to get embeddings for such graphs is a much easier way. Unlike embedding approaches that are based on matrix factorization, GraphSAGE leverage node features (e.g., text attributes, node profile information, node degrees) in order to learn an embedding function that generalizes to unseen nodes.\n",

    "### The start\n",
    "In the (GCN or DeepWalk) model, the graph was fixed beforehand, let's say the 'Zachary karate club', some model was trained on it, and then we could make predictions about a person X, if he/she went to a particular part of the club after separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Zachary Karate Club](img/karate_club.png \"Karate Club\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, the nodes in this graph were fixed from the beginning, and all the predictions were also to be made on these fixed nodes. In contrast to this, take an example where 'Youtube' videos are the nodes and assume there is an edge between related videos, and say we need to classify these videos depending on the content. If we take the same model as in the previous dataset, we can classify all these videos, but whenever a new video is added to 'YouTube', we will have to retrain the model on the entire new dataset again to classify it. This is not feasible as there will be too many videos or nodes being added everytime for us to retrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this issue, what we can do is not to learn embeddings for each node but to learn a function which, given the features and edges joining this node, will give the embeddings for the node. "

    "## Aggregating Neighbours\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to generate embeddings, based on the neighbourhood of a given node. In other words, the embedding of a node will depend upon the embedding of the nodes it is connected to. Like in the graph below, the node 1 and 2 are likely to be more similar than node 1 and 5.\n",
    "![Simple_graph](img/example_graph_1.png \"Simple Graph\")\n",
    "\n",
    "How can this idea be formulated?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we assign random values to the embeddings, and on each step, we will set the value of the embedding as the average of embeddings for all the nodes it is directly connected. The following example shows the working on a simple linear graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mean_Embeddings](img/animation.gif \"Mean Embeddings\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a straightforward idea, which can be generalized by representing it in the following way,\n",
    "![Simple_Neighbours](img/simple_neighbours.png \"Simple Neighbours\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Here The Black Box joining A with B, C, D represents some function of the A, B, C, D. ( In the above animation, it was the mean function). We can replace this box by any function like say sum or max. This function is known as the aggregator function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's try to make it more general by using not only the neighbours of a node but also the neighbours of the neighbours. The first question is how to make use of neighbours of neighbours. The way which we will be using here is to first generate each node's embedding in the first step by using only its neighbours just like we did above, and then in the second step, we will use these embeddings to generate the new embeddings. Take a look at the following \n",
    "\n",
    "![One_Layer_Aggregation](img/aggregation_1.png \"Aggregation Demo\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers written along with the nodes are the value of embedding at the time, T=0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values of embedding after one step are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Animation_aggregation_layer_1](img/animation_2_bw.gif \"Aggregation Layer 1\")\n",

    "So after one iteration, the values are as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "If you look closely, you will see that all the nodes that were either neighbour of A or neighbour of some neighbour of A are present in this term. It is equivalent to saying that all nodes that have a distance of less than or equal to 2 edges from A are influencing this term. Had there been a node G connected only to node F. then it is clearly at a distance of 3 from A and hence won't be influencing this term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalizing this we can say that if we repeat this produce N times, then all the nodes ( and only those nodes) that are at a within a distance N from the node will be influencing the value of the terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we replace the mean function, with some other function, lets say $F$, then, in this case, we can write,\n",

    "$$A^{(1)} = F(A^{(0)} , B^{(0)} , C^{(0)} , D^{(0)})$$\n",
