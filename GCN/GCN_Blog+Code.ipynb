    "\n",
    "If you are here and haven't skipped this section, then, we assume that you are a complete beginner, you may want to read everything very carefully. We can define a graph as a picture that represent the data in an organised manner. Let's go deep into applied graph theory. A graph (being directed or undirected) consists of set of vertices (or nodes) denoted by V and a set of edges denoted by E. Edges can be weighted or binary. Let's have a look of a graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above graph we have:-\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V = \\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = \\{(A,B), (B,C), (C,E), (B,D), (E,F), (D,E), (B,E), (G,E)\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Above all these edges their corresponding weights have been specified. These weights can represent different quantities.For example if we consider these nodes as different cities, edges can be the distance between these cities.\n",

    " - __Node__ : A node is an entity in the graph. Here, represented  by circles in the graph.\n",
    " - __Edge__ : It is the line joining two nodes in a graph. Presence of an edge between two nodes represent the relationship between the nodes. Here, represented by straight lines in the graph.\n",
    " - __Degree of a vertex__ : The degree of a vertex V of a graph G (denoted by deg (V)) is the number of edges incident with the vertex V. As an instance consider node B, it has 3 outgoing edges and 1 incoming edge, so outdegree is 3 and indegree is 1.\n",
    " - __Adjacency Matrix__ : It is a method of representing a graph using only a square Matrix. Suppose there are N nodes in a graph then there will be N rows and N columns in the corresponding adjacency matrix. The i'th row will contain a 1 in the j'th column if there is an edge between the i'th and the j'th node, otherwise, it will contain a 0."

    "\n",
    "So let's get into the real deal. Looking around us, we can observe that most of the real-world datasets come in the form of graphs or networks: social networks, protein-interaction networks, the World Wide Web, etc. This makes learning on graphs a very interesting problem that can solve tonnes of domain specific tasks rendering us with insightful information.\n",

CNNs are really powerful, they have the capacity to learn very high dimensional data. Say you have a $512*512$ pixels image. The dimensionality here is approximately 1 million. For 10 samples \n",

You may also have some representative information in the form of features about each person, for example, <i>A</i> may like movies starring Liam Neeson and in general <i>C</i> is a fan of genre Thriller, now you have to predict whether <i>A</i> is friend of <i>C</i>.\n",

    "## What GCNs?\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs), draw on the idea of Convolution Neural Networks re-defining them for the non-euclidean data domain. A regular Convolutional Neural Network used popularly for Image Recognition, captures the surrounding information of each pixel of an image. Similar to euclidean data like images, the convolution framework here aims to capture neighbourhood information for non euclidean spaces like graph nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A GCN is basically a neural network that operates on a graph. It will take a graph as an input and give some (we'll see what exactly) meaningful output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GCNs come in two different styles**: \n",
    "\n",
    " - **Spectral GCNs**: Spectral-based approaches define graph convolutions by introducing filters from the perspective of graph signal processing based on graph spectral theory.\n",
    " - **Spatial GCNs**: Spatial-based approaches formulate graph convolutions as aggregating feature information from neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Spectral approach has the limitation of the graph structure being same for all samples i.e. homogeneous structure. But it is a hard constraint, as most of the real-world graph data has different structures and size for different samples i.e. heterogeneous structure. Spatial approach is agnostic of graph structure."

    "\n",
    "First, let's work this out for the Friend Prediction problem and then we will generalize the approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement**: You are given N people and also a graph where there is an edge between two people if they are friends. You need to predict whether two people will become friends in the future or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple graph corresponding to this problem is:\n",
    "![img](img/friends_graph.png)\n",
    "Here person $(1,2)$ are friends, similarly $(2,3), (3,4), (4,1), (5,6), (6,8), (8,7), (7,6)$ are also friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are interested in finding out whether a given pair of people are likely to become friends in the future or not. Let's say that the pair we are interested in is $(1,3)$, now since they have 2 common friends we can softly imply they have a chance of becoming friends, whereas the nodes $(1,5)$ have no friend in common so they are less likely to become friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take another example:\n",
    "![img](img/friends_graph2.png)\n",
    "Here $(1,11)$ are much more likely to become friends than say $(3, 11)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the question that one can raise is 'How to implement and achieve this result?'. GCN's implement it in a way similar to CNNs. In a CNN we apply a filter on the original image to get the representation in next layer. Similarly in GCN we apply a filter which creates the next layer representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically we can define as follows: $$H^{i} = f(H^{i-1}, A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple example of $f$ maybe:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(H^{i}, A) = σ(AH^{i}W^{i})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    " - $A$ is the $N × N$ adjacency matrix\n",
    " - $X$ is the input feature matrix $N × F$, where $N$ is the number of nodes and $F$ is the number of input features for each node.\n",
    " - $σ$ is the Relu activation function\n",
    " - $H^{0} = X$ Each layer $H^{i}$ corresponds to an $N × F^{i}$ feature matrix where each row is a feature representation of a node.\n",
    " - $f$ is the propagation rule\n",
    " \n",
    "At each layer, these features are aggregated to form the next layer’s features using the propagation rule $f$. In this way, features become increasingly more abstract at each consecutive layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes that is it, we already have some function to propagate information across the graphs which can be trained in a semi-supervised way. Using the GCN layer, the representation of each node (each row) is now a sum of its neighbors features! In other words, the layer represents each node as an aggregate of its neighborhood."

    " - **The new node features $H^{i}$ are not a function of its previous representation**: As you might have noticed, the aggregated representation of a node is only a function of its neighbours and does not include its own features. If not handled, this may lead to the loss of the node identity and hence rendering the feature representations useless. We can easily fix this by adding self loops, that is an edge starting and ending on the same node, in this way a node will become a neighbour of itself. Mathematically, self loops are nothing but can be expressed by adding the node identity \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Degree of the nodes lead to the values being scaled asymmetricaly across the graph**: In simple words, nodes that have large number of neighbours (higher degree) will get much more input in the form of neighborhood aggregation from the adjacent nodes and hence will have a larger value and vice versa may be true for nodes with smaller degrees having small values. This can lead to problems during training the network. To deal with the issue, we will be using normalisation i.e, reduce all values in such a way that the values are on the same scale. Normalizing $A$ such that all rows sum to one, i.e. $D^{−1}A$, where $D$ is the diagonal node degree matrix, gets rid of this problem. Multiplying with $D^{−1}A$ now corresponds to taking the average of neighboring node features. According to the authors, after observing emperical results, they suggest \"In practice, dynamics get more interesting when we use a symmetric normalization, i.e. $\\hat{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\hat{A}\\hat{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ (as this no longer amounts to mere averaging of neighboring nodes).\n",
